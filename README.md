# Mase World Website

I created this website to act as a portfolio for my graphic design/photography work as well as a way to teach myself the basics of React. This is my first time using React and making a website. In future iterations I hope to migrate it to Next.js, possibly add more sections, and research more backend options.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
